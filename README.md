# Table Check Front End

## Geocding

In this project, Mapbox is integrated into the backend to automatically geocode restaurant addresses into precise latitude and longitude coordinates, ensuring that clean, consistent location data is always stored in the database. This removes the need for the frontend to handle geocoding and guarantees reliable results regardless of client device or network. On the frontend, Mapbox is used solely for rendering interactive maps and markers, providing users with a smooth and visually engaging way to explore restaurants by location.

- BackEnd Benefits = data quality, consistency, automation

- FrontEnd Benefits = visualization, user experience
